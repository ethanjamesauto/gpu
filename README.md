A graphics card creating using 7400-series ICs

This graphics card was designed using [Digital](https://github.com/hneemann/Digital), a logism-like IDE with built-in 7400-series IC models.

Generating sprite data from PNGs is possible using data.ipynb, and the graphics card output RAM data can be converted to graphical data using screen.ipynb.
